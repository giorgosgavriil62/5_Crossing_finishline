The project starts by importing essential libraries and loading multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame. After removing columns with over 50% missing values and rows where the target variable is null, we preprocess airline names, normalize distance, and engineer new features such as seasonality and time of day. Binary classification is created based on arrival delays. Exploratory visualizations illustrate delay patterns by time of day, airline, airport, and season. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers are implemented first, evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC AUC metrics—Decision Tree slightly outperforming Logistic Regression across the board. We then build a more feature-rich dataset incorporating numerical variables, stratify the training split, and visualize the target’s class imbalance. After trying SMOTE and opting for RandomUnderSampler for efficiency, we train a Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV, evaluate its performance, and visualize feature importance using permutation scores. Finally, we implement an AdaBoost model, tuning its depth and learning rate via cross-validation, and evaluate its performance. Results across all models are merged into a comparative table, forming a solid baseline for improving delay prediction through additional features and more advanced ensemble techniques.
